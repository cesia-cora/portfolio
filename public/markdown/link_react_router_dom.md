# Handling In-Page Navigation with react-router-dom's Link Component

`2024, May 5`

When trying to use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` to handle in-page navigation, I often encounter a specific issue: it does not automatically handle scrolling to an element with a specific ID on a new page. When you want to use `Link` to navigate to a specific section of a different page, `Link` alone does not manage the scroll position after navigation.

To overcome this limitation, you can apply an `useNavigate` hook in combination with a custom function to manually handle the scrolling. Here's how you can implement this:

``import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'`` 

    const navigate = useNavigate();

    const handleNavigate = (path, hash) => {
        navigate(path);
        setTimeout(() => {
            const element = document.getElementById(hash.replace('#', ''));
            if (element) {
                element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
            }
        }, 0);
    };

In this workaround, `navigate` is used to change the route, and a `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 ms is used to queue the scrolling action until after the new page has rendered. This ensures that the element you want to scroll to is available in the DOM.

Now you can call `handleNavigate` in your link:

`<Link to='/' onClick={() => handleNavigate('/', '#Index')}>Link name</Link>`

This approach provides a reliable way to combine routing and in-page navigation when using `react-router-dom`.
